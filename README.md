# SRNFTPLBWN (Some random name for this programming language, because why not?)

SRNFTPLBWN (SRN for short) is a programing (scripting) language, design to do basic stuff and to help people learn concepts about programming.

---
## _Current version_: `v1.0.0a`

## _Requirements_:
 - Python 3.10 or above (im too lazy to make this backwards compatible)
 - `rich` module for debugging (this is still an Alpha version)

### **WARNING:** _Because this is an ESOTERIC language, you may expect easy learning curves. But sooner or later, you'll definitely find out that this language isn't suitable for making programs._
