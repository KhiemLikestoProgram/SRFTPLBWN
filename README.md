# SRNFTPLBWN (Some random name for this programming language, because why not?)

SRNFTPLBWN (SRN for short) is a programing (scripting) language, design to do basic stuff and to help people learn concepts about programming.

---
## _Current version_: `v1.0.0a`

## _Requirements_:
 - Python 3.10 or above (im too lazy to make this backwards compatible)
 - `rich` module for debugging (this is still an Alpha version)

---
### This program also has a debug mode and a help message.
### How to interpret the file:
1. Type `python __init__.py some-path-to-the-file.srn [-d | -?]` in your terminal.
2. Type `srn some-path-to-the-file.srn [-d | -?]` in your terminal.
3. Double click on a `.srn` file (will implementing soon, experimental).

#### **WARNING:** _Because this is a (probably esoteric) language, you may expect easy learning curves. But this language isn't suitable for making programs, so don't make programs with it (itwillbeveryslowandbuggy)._
